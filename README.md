###Approach Taken

**1. Planning Phase**

After understanding the project requirements I immediately started to create my ERD and Wireframe to get a better understanding of the scope of my app.

**Trello board**:

**2. Set up the back-end and have the flow of data ready for front-end**

I started by creating my server to make sure the app is able to create Users and Games.

**3. Work with front-end**

After setting up the back-end I moved to the front end to work with react. I made sure I organized the react files in a neat and easy to read format.

**4. Polish**

Once the MVP is done. I made sure keep testing the features to find for bugs.
